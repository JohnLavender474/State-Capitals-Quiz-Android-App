### Project Description:

This project is a quiz app that tests the user's knowledge of the state capitals of the
United States. The user is presented with quiz of six questions where in each question a
random state is presented and the user must select the correct capital from a list of three
options. The user is given a score based on the number of correct answers and the number
of incorrect answers. The results of finished quizzes are saved and can be viewed in the
results page. Also, the user can pause a quiz and continue it at a later point even after 
the app has been quit.
